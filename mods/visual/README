teklib/mods/visual/README - Notes about the Visual module

2004-01-17 [tmueller]

Please note that the Amiga implementation requires guigfx.library and
render.library to be installed. This dependency may be removed later.

The visual module is now implemented as an asynchronous I/O device.
Its main purpose is now to serve as an example for writing devices.


2003-12-19 [tmueller]

The 'visual' module was a prototype and is now obsolete. It will be
superseded by the 'displayhandler' in the future. Support for the
'visual' module is continued as long as there are tests and examples
using its API.
