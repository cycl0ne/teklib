-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEKlib's documentation system is based on plain text documents and a
commandline tool to convert subtle forms of markup into HTML or XML.
Markup is mainly performed by means of indentation and elements that
would appear in plain text documentation anyway.

	- [[Blocks]]
	- [[Indentation]]

	- [[Lists]]
	- [[Definitions]]
	- [[Nodes]]
	- [[Links]]
	- [[Tables]]
	- [[Headings]]
	- [[Rules]]
	- [[Emphasis]]

The markup format was inspired by Amiga autodocs, MoinMoin Wiki and
Aptconvert.

@@ Usage @@

Use the commandline tool {{gendoc.lua}} to convert plain text
documents into marked-up formats such as HTML and XML (and any other
format for which a set of conversion rules may exist). 

Argument template:

	FROM/A		|| source document
	TO/K		|| destination document [default: stdout]
	MODE/K		|| conversion mode [default: html]
	DEBUG/S		|| print a stacktrace in case of internal errors
	NOTOC/S		|| do not generate a table of contents
	HELP/S		|| get help
	
Example:

		$ bin/linux/lua bin/gendoc.lua INSTALL to doc/html/install.html

Get help:

		$ bin/linux/lua bin/gendoc.lua help

(See also a description of TEKlib's 
[[commandline templates][util:TParseArgV]].)

@@ Blocks @@

Text of a consistent indentation level running uninterrupted by empty
lines is combined into blocks. Lines in blocks can break at any position,
the breaks are not included to the result. Example:

		This is a
		block.

		This is
		another block.

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This is a block.
	
	This is another block.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Indentation @@

Indentation is measured as the consecutive number of tabs at the
beginning of a line; different indentation levels will be taken into
account accordingly:

		This is a
		block.

		    This is
		    another block.

		        This is a third block.

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This is a block.
	
		This is another block.
		
			This is a third block.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Preformatted @@

For blocks of code and other kinds of preformatted text use an indentation
that is ''two levels deeper'' than the current level, e.g.:

		Normal text
		
		        /* Code markup */
		
		Back to normal

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Normal text

			/* Code markup */
			
	Back to normal
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To indent within blocks of preformatted text you have to indent twice;
first by using tabs at the beginning of the line, and after that by using
spaces throughout the rest of the line:

		if (you_use_spaces)
		{
		    /* No problem to indent in code */
		}
		
@@ Code @@

Inlined code is marked up between double braces. It may occur at any
position in a line, but the opening and the closing of the markup must
occur in the same line:

		This is {{code_markup}} in running text.

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This is {{code_markup}} in running text.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that there is no way to escape double braces outside preformatted
text.
	
@@ Lists @@

There are two types of list items; ''soft'' items and ''bulleted'' items.
They are recognized by their respective character (dash or asterisk),
followed by a whitespace at the beginning of a line:

		- soft item
		* bulleted item

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- soft item
	* bulleted item
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Soft items are a natural means to enforce line breaks:

		- this is a line,
		- this is another line,
		- this is a third line.

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- this is a line,
	- this is another line,
	- this is a third line.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lists follow the same indentation rules as normal text:

		* one
		* two
		* three
		    * eins
		    * zwei
		        - ichi
		        - ni
		        - san
		    * drei

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	* one
	* two
	* three
		* eins
		* zwei
			- ichi
			- ni
			- san
		* drei
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although not striclty required, it is recommended to
[[indent][Indentation]] lists by one indentation step. This will help
the parser to avoid ambiguities; when a regular [[block][Blocks]]
follows an unindented list, it is concatenated with the last list
item.


@@ Definitions @@

Definitions are a logical markup and introduced by using an uppercase word
at the beginning of a line, which is followed by a double colon:

		SYNOPSIS::
		    The TEKlib document generator
			
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SYNOPSIS::
		The TEKlib document generator

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first character must be an uppercase letter, the following characters
may be uppercase letters, digits, whitespaces and underscores.

@@ Nodes @@

Nodes are an important logical markup that groups a document into
sections or chapters. Nodes will automatically enter the
''Table of contents'' ([[TOC]]) and receive a header with navigation
elements, and they can be referenced by external documents (see [[Links]]).
It is wiser to group documents into nodes than by just using
[[Headings]], the latter being simple layout elements.

Nodes are enclosed by double at symbols and at least one whitespace on
each side. The first character must be a letter, the remaining characters
must be letters, digits, dots, colons, underscores or dashes.
		
		@@ Node @@
		
		    This is a node with the name "Node".

A special notation allows for nodes with a title that is different from
the node name:

		@@ Node : A fancy title @@
		    
		    This is a node with the name "Node" and a fancy title.

@@ Links @@

There are six types of links; ''simple'', ''named'', ''external'',
''function'', ''external function'' and ''URL''.

* A simple link can reference a [[Node][Nodes]] in the current document:

		This is a simple link referring to the [[Links]] section.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	This is a simple link referring to the [[Links]] section.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* A named link:

		This is the same link with a [[different title][Links]].
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	This is the same link with a [[different title][Links]].
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* A named link, referring to another document in TEKlib's notation.
The symbol after the colon denotes the node to jump to. Leave the
name behind the colon empty if you do not want to access a specific node.

		This is how you can get to the [[Exec reference manual][exec:INDEX]].
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Function link:

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	This is a function() link.
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Function link with an external target:

@@ Tables @@

Lines running uninterrupted with at least one cell separator in each
of them automtically form a table. The cell separator is a double
vertical bar:

		First cell || Second cell
		Third cell || Fourth cell
		
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	First cell || Second cell
	Third cell || Fourth cell
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is also possible to create empty cells as long as the separators
are present. Note, by the way, that cell separators do not necessarily
need to be aligned exactly below each other:

		First cell ||  || third cell
		  || fifth cell ||
		
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	First cell ||  || third cell
	  || fifth cell || 
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Note however that an empty cell at the beginning of a line must be filled
with spaces rather than tabs, otherwise the document format would become
ambiguous.

@@ Headings @@

Headings are a layouting markup; they are mainly used to group nodes
into sections and subsections. Unlike [[Nodes]], they do not have a logical
meaning.

		== Heading 1 ==
		
		=== Heading 2 ===
		
		==== Heading 3 ====

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	== Heading 1 ==
			
	=== Heading 2 ===
	
	==== Heading 3 ====
	
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Headings occupy an entire line. They are enclosed by at least two
equal signs and a whitspace on each side; the more equal signs, the
less significant the section.

@@ Rules @@

A minimum of four dashes is interpreted as a horizontal rule. They may
occur at arbitrary indentation levels, but they must occupy the whole line:

		before the rule
		----------------------------------------------
		after the rule
	
	before the rule
	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	after the rule
	
@@ Emphasis @@

An emphasis is a layouting markup. It may occur at any position in a line,
but the opening and the closing of the markup must occur in the ''same'' line.

The emphasized text is surrounded by at least two ticks on each side; the
more ticks, the stronger the emphasis.

		- normal
		- ''emphasis''
		- '''strong emphasis'''
		- ''''very strong emphasis''''

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	- normal
	- ''emphasis''
	- '''strong emphasis'''
	- ''''very strong emphasis''''
