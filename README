=== About ===

TEKlib is an open-source library and operating system effort under
the terms of the free MIT software license. This project has a many
of facets; it is a 

	* virtual operating system that runs hosted on platforms such as
	Linux, Windows, BSD and MorphOS, 
	
	* freestanding operating system on architectures such as the
	Playstation 2, where it runs on a thin layer of ROM calls, 

	* middleware providing a constistent interface across all hosting
	environments, 

	* component library in that it is not strictly limited to OS services, 
	
	* development platform that comes with a cross-platform build system
	and documentation tools.

Its freestanding nature, small footprint and absence of global data
recommend it as a layer for portability and code reuse in many
environments; TEKlib's role is that of a ''local'' or
''logical operating system'' that can be deployed inside applications
likewise as on top of hardware.
